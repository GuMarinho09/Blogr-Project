          Blogr is a free and open source application backed by a large
          community of helpful developers. It supports features such as code
          syntax highlighting, RSS feeds, social media integration, third-party
          commenting tools, and works seamlessly with Google Analytics. The
          architecture is clean and is relatively easy to learn.

        <h3>Powerful tooling</h3>
        <p>
          Batteries included. We built a simple and straightforward CLI tool
          that makes customization and deployment a breeze, but capable of
          producing even the most complicated sites.
